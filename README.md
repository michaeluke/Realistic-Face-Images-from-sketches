# Realistic-Face-Images-from-sketches
Converting portraits sketches into realistic human faces using deep learning &amp; using a pre-trained model (Pix2pixHD) to train the neural network.
pre-processing the sketches to make it more enhanced using Matlab.
Using Google colab. to run the project and train/test the model.
